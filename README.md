# FairScan

FairScan is an Android app to scan documents. It aims to be simple and respectful.

"Simple" means that users should get a clean PDF in seconds and without thinking:
- The user interface should be super clear, with no distraction.
- The scanning process should be obvious.
- The app should automatically handle all image processing and PDF generation tasks.
